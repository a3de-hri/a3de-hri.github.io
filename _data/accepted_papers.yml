#   abstract: In neuroscience, attention has been associated operationally with enhanced
#     processing of certain sensory inputs depending on external or internal contexts
#     such as cueing, salience, or mental states. In machine learning, attention usually
#     means a multiplicative mechanism whereby the weights in a weighted summation of
#     an input vector are calculated from the input itself or some other context vector.
#     In both scenarios, attention can be conceptualized as a gating mechanism. In this
#     paper, we argue that three-way interactions serve as a normative way to define
#     a gating mechanism in generative probabilistic graphical models. By going a step
#     beyond pairwise interactions, it empowers much more computational efficiency,
#     like a transistor expands possible digital computations. Models with three-way
#     interactions are also easier to scale up and thus to implement biologically. As
#     an example application, we show that a graphical model with three-way interactions
#     provides a normative explanation for divisive normalization in macaque primary
#     visual cortex, an operation adopted widely throughout the cortex to reduce redundancy,
#     save energy, and improve computation.

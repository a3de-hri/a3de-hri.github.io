This full-day **Friday** workshop addresses the problems of accessibility in HRI and the interplay of ethical considerations for disability-centered design and research, accessibility concerns for disabled researchers, and the design of assistive HRI technologies. We invite authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, excluding references) and short papers (up to 4 pages, excluding references) on a range of topics relevant to ethics, accessibility, and assistive applications
in HRI, including critical reflections on methodologies, design papers on human-centered or anti-ableist assistive technology, and papers from those outside the HRI community who may have insight to share on these concerns.
The workshop will use a hybrid format to allow participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel, and will feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, and breakout sessions.

## Topics of Interest

This workshop will bring together people interested in the accessibility of the HRI community, assistive technology researchers, and people interested in research ethics from all areas of HRI (technical, social, psychological, design, etc.) to explore guidelines around research ethics in this area of HRI, as well as new directions for this area of research.

- Ethics of HRI in the context research for or about disabled people, including critical self-reflections on studies
- Accessibility of the HRI community
- Assistive Technologies

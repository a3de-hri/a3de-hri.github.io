This full-day workshop addresses the problems of accessibility in HRI and the interplay of ethical considerations for disability-centered design and research, accessibility concerns for disabled researchers, and the design of assistive HRI technologies.  

The workshop will include keynote speakers from academia and industry, a discussion with expert academic, industry, and disability advocate panelists, and activities and breakout sessions designed to facilitate conversations about the accessibility of the HRI community, assistive technology researchers, and research ethics from all areas of HRI (technical, social, psychological, design, etc.)  We will explore guidelines around research ethics in this area of HRI, as well as new directions for this area of research.

The workshop will use a hybrid format to allow participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel.

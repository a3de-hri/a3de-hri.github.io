## Call for Contributions

This full-day **Friday** workshop will use a hybrid format to more readily include participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel.  We will have two keynote speakers: Laurel Riek and Charles Kemp.  Dr. Riek, a professor of Computer Science at UC San Diego, is an expert in inclusive robotics in healthcare contexts and a leader in applying the social model of disability to HRI research.  Dr. Kemp, CTO of Hello Robot, Inc., is a pioneer of co-design methods for assistive HRI and a leader in real-world deployment of in-home assistive robots. The remainder of the workshop will focus on panel discussions grouped from submitted papers, and small breakout groups. We expect 20-30 participants, although if there is more than expected interest in participation, we will substitute a poster session for the panel discussions and increase the size of the workshop. 

We will organize themed discussion sessions around the key topics raised by accepted paper submissions, which we expect to fall into one (or more) of three categories:
- Ethics of HRI in the context research for or about disabled people, including critical self-reflections on studies
- Accessibility of the HRI community
- Assistive Technologies

## Call for Contributions

We invite authors to submit: 
- extended abstracts up to 2 pages, excluding references)
- short papers (up to 4 pages, excluding references) 

on a range of topics relevant to ethics, accessibility, and assistive applications in HRI, including:
- Design papers on human-centered or anti-ableist assistive technology
- Experience reports: personal reflections on disabilities and assistive robotics (see https://assets23.sigaccess.org/experience-reports.html for a description)
- Critical reflections on past or ongoing research projects related to disability
- Methodological or tutorial papers on best practices in disability-centered HRI
- Position papers on topics related to disability-centered HRI
- Papers from those outside the traditional HRI community with insight into disability-centered HRI

Submissions should conform to the HRI 2024 submission instructions on [format](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/fullpaper/), [anonymity](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/guides-for-anonymizing-submissions/), and [accessibility](https://humanrobotinteraction.org/2024/accessibility/).

Similar to the main HRI conference, all submissions should be made following the general ACM SIG format (“sigconf”, double column format) and not the SIGCHI format. Templates can be found [here](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) or on Overleaf directly.

The workshop will use a hybrid format to allow participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel.

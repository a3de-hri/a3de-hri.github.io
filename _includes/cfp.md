## Call for Contributions

This full-day **Friday** workshop addresses the problems of accessibility in HRI and the interplay of ethical considerations for disability-centered design and research, accessibility concerns for disabled researchers, and the design of assistive HRI technologies. We invite authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, excluding references) and short papers (up to 4 pages, excluding references) on a range of topics relevant to ethics, accessibility, and assistive applications
in HRI, including critical reflections on methodologies, design papers on human-centered or anti-ableist assistive technology, and papers from those outside the HRI community who may have insight to share on these concerns.
The workshop will use a hybrid format to allow participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel, and will feature keynote speakers, panel discussions, and breakout sessions.

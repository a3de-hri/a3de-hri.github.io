## Call for Contributions

 We invite authors to submit extended abstracts (up to 2 pages, excluding references) and short papers (up to 4 pages, excluding references) on a range of topics relevant to ethics, accessibility, and assistive applications in HRI, including critical reflections on methodologies, design papers on human-centered or anti-ableist assistive technology, and papers from those outside the HRI community who may have insight to share on these concerns.

Similar to the main HRI conference, all submissions should be made following the general ACM SIG format (“sigconf”, double column format) and not the SIGCHI format. Templates can be found here or on Overleaf directly.

The workshop will use a hybrid format to allow participants who due to disability, geographic, financial, or other constraints, are unable to travel.

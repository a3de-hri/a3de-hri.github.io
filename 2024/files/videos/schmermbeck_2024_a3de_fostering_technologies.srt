Hello, and very warm welcome from my side.

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,690
My name is Katharina Schmermbeck, and I'm very happy to talk a bit about our initiative,

3
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:15,490
which we can present at the A3DE workshop at the HRI

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:19,190
conference in Boulder of this year.

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:26,390
So what is our initiative about?  We try to bring more inclusion

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,390
in our region the city of Innsbruck by bringing together different

7
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:38,990
stakeholders and the community to the Design and Co-design of assistive technologies.

8
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:45,990
We offer different co-design lectures within bachelor's

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,090
as well as Masters Degree. The Bachelor's degree course is in the

10
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:56,090
field of engineering whlle the Master's course is open to all students, so an

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,390
an interdisciplinary course where students work together with people

12
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:05,090
with disabilities on AT projects.

13
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,190
We combine the teaching and research with a community

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,890
transfer which we do by offering and organizing a regular open Forum,

15
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:22,890
which happens in the city and here people can come together and

16
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:27,990
talk about Assistive Technologies, talk about solutions, experiences they made

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:34,290
because we felt that a lot of people also don't know what is happening on the market.

18
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,690
They might have not seen any solutions others have

19
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,790
seen and so we try to bring together ideas and exchange.

20
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:45,690
In the courses,

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:50,790
however, we built Assistive Technologies with students and people with disabilities.

22
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:56,590
They form groups and build Assistive Technologies

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:01,290
while always meeting regularly over the whole semester.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:03,790
Now, one year after practice,

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,990
we looked into its impact on the development of Assistive Technologies.

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,490
And also on the mitigation of ableism.

27
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:18,890
You can look up all the results here on the poster where I also marked who

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:26,790
from the people I interviewed were having the same opinion on different topics.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:33,890
What we concluded is that we can meet individual requirements

30
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:39,890
when developing Assistive Technologies together in these expert teams in the courses.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,090
However, it's especially the short amount of time in one semester

32
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,990
and grading and also knowledge and background constraints

33
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,690
of students necessitate that we continue developments also in upcoming semesters.

34
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:01,090
What we also saw is that the initiative has very positive influence

35
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:05,990
on participants and their views and attitudes towards people with

36
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,490
disabilities because a lot of the students and also other participants

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,190
were never really in contact with people with disabilities so that could

38
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,490
learn a lot and however,

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:25,090
we see that only few people participate and for a big change,

40
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,990
we believe that it's very important to offer these courses also

41
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,290
as a definite part in the university and

42
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:41,490
also in multiple degrees and also courses where all students need to go.

43
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,590

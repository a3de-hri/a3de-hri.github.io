00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.111
Within the domain of robotic
solutions for accessibility,

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-1
00:00:04.111 --> 00:00:07.142
automation has begun to play an
increasingly bigger role.

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-2
00:00:07.142 --> 00:00:10.017
Automation can of course be
useful. It can make things

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-3
00:00:10.017 --> 00:00:13.362
faster and easier. However, the
relationship between automation

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-4
00:00:13.362 --> 00:00:16.602
and user autonomy ought to be
more critically examined. Let's

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-5
00:00:16.602 --> 00:00:19.581
take the example of mobile
robotic telepresence. Robotic

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-6
00:00:19.581 --> 00:00:22.926
telepresence refers to remotely
controlling a robot so as to be

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-7
00:00:22.926 --> 00:00:26.271
present in another environment,
and this allows people to be in

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-8
00:00:26.271 --> 00:00:29.511
a space where they could not
travel to in person. Automations

dfa71121-549d-442a-a5fd-d3b8a6543d5a-9
00:00:29.511 --> 00:00:31.550
in robotic telepresence include
robots

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-0
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.219
that can drive autonomously in
space, robots that automatically

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-1
00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.799
follow people in the
environment, robots that

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-2
00:00:37.799 --> 00:00:41.220
automatically track what is
happening in the environment and

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-3
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.809
adjust the user's case, robots
that automatically adjust to the

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-4
00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.342
appropriate distance from other
people in the environment, and

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-5
00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:51.876
even robots that translate what
the user is trying to say into

26d7514b-6ea4-4c20-b3c3-a674fe1fe174-6
00:00:51.876 --> 00:00:53.110
more polite phrasings.

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-0
00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.133
Some of these automation can
make the robots easier to use,

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-1
00:00:58.133 --> 00:01:01.816
as they require less input from
the users. However, it also

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-2
00:01:01.816 --> 00:01:05.253
means that the user has less
control over how the robot

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-3
00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:08.752
behaves, and this can have
various implications, such as

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-4
00:01:08.752 --> 00:01:12.558
the fact that the users have
less opportunity for spontaneity

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-5
00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:15.934
and exploration and less
opportunity for playful close

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-6
00:01:15.934 --> 00:01:19.924
contact with the world and other
people. Since the movements the

7eec48f0-dbb5-4d44-a2ce-5278d007758f-7
00:01:19.924 --> 00:01:23.730
automated movements are robots
tend to be collision avoidant,

4f0746a5-9b54-4ac0-a473-f87ead3c8c0c-0
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.909
our behaviours become more
uniform and filtered through the

4f0746a5-9b54-4ac0-a473-f87ead3c8c0c-1
00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.516
robot so there is less diversity
in the behaviours of the robots

4f0746a5-9b54-4ac0-a473-f87ead3c8c0c-2
00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:32.960
Exhibit.

5aa3e6f2-464a-40e6-8c51-e7cf6b709394-0
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.745
We subjugate control over what
movements and behaviours, um,

5aa3e6f2-464a-40e6-8c51-e7cf6b709394-1
00:01:37.745 --> 00:01:41.751
are appropriate for robots to
make to the organisations that

5aa3e6f2-464a-40e6-8c51-e7cf6b709394-2
00:01:41.751 --> 00:01:44.050
design and deploy this
technology.

5692351b-86c2-450d-81e3-2cecfe3e45b3-0
00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.014
And users have less control over
their self-expression and they

5692351b-86c2-450d-81e3-2cecfe3e45b3-1
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:51.620
are less intentional in
participation.

f2eb6a38-5811-4541-9dc8-feeabd7248d3-0
00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.625
These are just some examples.
Robotic telepresence as well as

f2eb6a38-5811-4541-9dc8-feeabd7248d3-1
00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:01.370
other assistive technologies
quite literally mediate between

f2eb6a38-5811-4541-9dc8-feeabd7248d3-2
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.561
a person and how their
intentions are manifested in

f2eb6a38-5811-4541-9dc8-feeabd7248d3-3
00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:08.551
their world as well as how that
person experiences analysis that

f2eb6a38-5811-4541-9dc8-feeabd7248d3-4
00:02:08.551 --> 00:02:08.920
world.

e845e825-de82-41bb-946e-730e4e976cef-0
00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.075
Some Automating this technology
means automating users presence

e845e825-de82-41bb-946e-730e4e976cef-1
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:17.524
in the world and the
implications of this need to be

e845e825-de82-41bb-946e-730e4e976cef-2
00:02:17.524 --> 00:02:18.110
examined.

3d175391-3d16-45f4-ae20-4c23f39b7cb1-0
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.212
The relationship between
automation and user autonomy

3d175391-3d16-45f4-ae20-4c23f39b7cb1-1
00:02:23.212 --> 00:02:26.972
needs to be better understood.
In some cases this relationship

3d175391-3d16-45f4-ae20-4c23f39b7cb1-2
00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:30.553
can be seen as a tradeoff.
Automation makes use easier, but

3d175391-3d16-45f4-ae20-4c23f39b7cb1-3
00:02:30.553 --> 00:02:33.179
at the cost of some of the
user's autonomy.

af5daf96-766f-4cae-adf3-1a6a87607b4b-0
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.204
However, there are situations
where it can also be a win win

af5daf96-766f-4cae-adf3-1a6a87607b4b-1
00:02:38.204 --> 00:02:42.258
where automation can enable user
autonomy if it makes it allows

af5daf96-766f-4cae-adf3-1a6a87607b4b-2
00:02:42.258 --> 00:02:46.060
the robot to behave in ways that
respect the user's wishes.

8ccb728f-3077-4878-99e4-4c318c6d1bee-0
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.004
More research on the different
dimensions of automated robot

8ccb728f-3077-4878-99e4-4c318c6d1bee-1
00:02:52.004 --> 00:02:56.248
mediated actions is certainly
needed in conjunction with how

8ccb728f-3077-4878-99e4-4c318c6d1bee-2
00:02:56.248 --> 00:03:00.353
this intersects with disability
and the expression of self

8ccb728f-3077-4878-99e4-4c318c6d1bee-3
00:03:00.353 --> 00:03:04.667
identity with contextual factors
and how it aligns with users

8ccb728f-3077-4878-99e4-4c318c6d1bee-4
00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:05.850
values and needs.

00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Assistive technology is worthless if it is not accessible.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,000
This presentation is meant to raise awareness of the complexities of connected assistive technologies.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
I explore these through the lens of a Bluetooth-enabled hearing aid.

4
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Bluetooth-enabled hearing aids have many features, including:

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Preset programs optimized for hearing in different environments
 
6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Monitoring and tracking hearing aid usage and physical activities

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Fall detection with automatic text alerts sent to a designated contact list

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Spoken language translated to a preferred target language

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Headset capabilities enabling clear calls and streamed content like music, podcasts and audio books.

10
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
All this technology is great when the Bluetooth connectivity works. 

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
However, when it doesn't, failures in connectivity become a common roadblock to full feature accessibility.

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Bluetooth failures are usually connected to software or firmware updates.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:60,000
They can also be caused by interference from other devices or from switching from Wi-Fi to cellular data.

14
00:00:60,000 --> 00:01:07,000
For someone not familiar with technology, fixing connectivity issues can be a tedious, confusing process.

15
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Sometimes reconnection can involve almost 20 steps.

16
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Some people just give up and never enjoy the full capabilities of their hearing aids.

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:20,000
Fixing connectivity issues should not be this hard.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,000
Sometimes the accessibility issues caused by connectivity issues are inconvenient.

19
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Conversations may not be as clear.

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Programs that allow optimization of sound settings are no longer available.

21
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,000
There is no more streaming of content to one's hearing aids, and hearing and health monitoring no longer works.

22
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,500
Sometimes the consequences are dangerous.

23
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:50,000
Disconnection to a navigation aid while driving means you are no longer able to hear the driving directions. You could get lost in an unfamiliar place.

24
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Unreliable features like fall detection give false expectations of safety.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,000
If a user falls, a fall alert will no longer be sent to their designated contact list.

26
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Inaccessible features, no matter how wonderful, do no one any good.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
When designing assistive technology, there are four important metrics to consider.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Reliability. A product needs to behave as expected.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Availability. As users of assistive technology are often dependent on it, it must be operational when they need it.

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Serviceability. Maintaining or fixing a product should be simple, not a 20-step process.

31
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Accessibility. If a person cannot understand how to use a product, it is not accessible.

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,000
When designing new technologies, developers need to:

33
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Recognize that most users lack the background to navigate technology hiccups.

33
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:47,000
They need to employ non-tech savvy testers before product rollouts and coordinate software updates that affect device connectivity.

34
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But most importantly, they need to remember that people rely on their products to work when needed.

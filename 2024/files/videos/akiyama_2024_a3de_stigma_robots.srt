00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,169
hi my name is Tanaka Akiyama

2
00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:03,489
and I'm going to present our paper

3
00:00:03,489 --> 00:00:05,949
which explores stigma and service robots

4
00:00:06,734 --> 00:00:09,134
as our world increasingly integrates service

5
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,654
robots into various facets of daily life

6
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:14,714
it's crucial to reassess their purpose and user base

7
00:00:15,014 --> 00:00:17,094
today we'll delve into a critical aspect

8
00:00:17,094 --> 00:00:18,594
that's often overlooked

9
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:21,074
stigma and the design of service robots

10
00:00:21,934 --> 00:00:23,814
let's first distinguish between assistive

11
00:00:23,814 --> 00:00:24,994
and service robots

12
00:00:25,334 --> 00:00:27,854
assistive robots cater to specific user groups

13
00:00:27,854 --> 00:00:29,134
such as elderly care

14
00:00:29,134 --> 00:00:32,274
or educational assistance for children with autism

15
00:00:32,494 --> 00:00:33,654
on the other hand

16
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:36,314
service robots provide assistive functionality

17
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,154
but are designed for communal use

18
00:00:38,334 --> 00:00:39,614
serving diverse users

19
00:00:39,614 --> 00:00:41,434
regardless of their abilities

20
00:00:42,014 --> 00:00:44,534
we can think of service robots as public facing

21
00:00:44,534 --> 00:00:46,474
robots that have assistive features

22
00:00:46,614 --> 00:00:48,534
that's why it's important to look at stigma

23
00:00:48,534 --> 00:00:50,294
as it is a prominent challenge regarding

24
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:52,634
the acceptance of assistive technology

25
00:00:53,734 --> 00:00:56,095
stigma manifests in various forms

26
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:57,701
consider this scenario

27
00:00:57,881 --> 00:01:00,541
a person is using a robot for grocery shopping

28
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:02,241
from an observer standpoint

29
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:04,361
they might perceive the user as helpless

30
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:06,341
reflecting perceived stigma

31
00:01:06,681 --> 00:01:09,821
conversely the user might experience self stigma

32
00:01:09,841 --> 00:01:10,721
fearing judgment

33
00:01:10,721 --> 00:01:12,541
and questioning their capabilities

34
00:01:12,841 --> 00:01:14,121
both forms of stigma have

35
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:16,921
the potential to significantly influence the acceptance

36
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:20,101
usability and effectiveness of service robots

37
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,761
stigma link to the utilization of assistive technology

38
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,941
or robots has been well documented

39
00:01:26,161 --> 00:01:27,841
existing literature highlights how

40
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:30,521
older adults often perceive the use of assistive robots

41
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:32,221
as a symbol of dependency

42
00:01:32,321 --> 00:01:34,841
which they consider an insurmountable barrier to

43
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:35,981
accepting robots

44
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:38,241
while exploring

45
00:01:38,241 --> 00:01:40,681
established frameworks for the technology acceptance

46
00:01:40,681 --> 00:01:43,101
such as the Technology Acceptance model

47
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:45,681
it's notable that stigma is not accounted for

48
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:47,821
although it is a significant factor

49
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:49,441
progress has been made with

50
00:01:49,441 --> 00:01:51,801
the inclusion of a stigma category in the Unified

51
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:54,181
Theory of acceptance and use of technology

52
00:01:54,521 --> 00:01:56,941
however there's still room for refinement

53
00:01:57,001 --> 00:01:59,521
particularly in differentiating between self stigma

54
00:01:59,521 --> 00:02:00,901
and perceived stigma

55
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,401
psychology does

56
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,581
offer more comprehensive methods for evaluating stigma

57
00:02:05,641 --> 00:02:08,761
and investigating their relevance to robotics and HRI

58
00:02:08,761 --> 00:02:09,781
is warranted

59
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:13,781
so how can we address the stigma surrounding robot use

60
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:16,381
one strategy is universal design

61
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,721
aiming to make systems

62
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:20,541
accessible to individuals with diverse abilities

63
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:21,721
this approach reduces

64
00:02:21,721 --> 00:02:24,321
the necessity for specialized adaptations

65
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,741
and normalizes the use of service robots

66
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:30,041
another approach involves integrating robots

67
00:02:30,041 --> 00:02:32,381
inconspicuously into the environment

68
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:34,921
while this tactic addresses perceived stigma

69
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,401
it may not effectively tackle

70
00:02:36,401 --> 00:02:38,561
the primary issue of self stigma

71
00:02:38,561 --> 00:02:39,721
which holds significant

72
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:41,701
importance for technology adoption

73
00:02:42,361 --> 00:02:43,161
additionally

74
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,481
marketing strategies have been

75
00:02:44,481 --> 00:02:46,821
proposed to destigmatize images

76
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:48,701
of assistive robotics

77
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:50,801
particularly targeting older adults

78
00:02:50,801 --> 00:02:52,341
to increase acceptance

79
00:02:52,681 --> 00:02:53,601
nevertheless

80
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:55,801
future research is essential to assess the

81
00:02:55,801 --> 00:02:59,601
effectiveness of these approaches in closing

82
00:02:59,601 --> 00:03:02,461
we've identified crucial areas for exploration

83
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:05,241
researchers should focus on investigating how service

84
00:03:05,241 --> 00:03:05,961
robots can be

85
00:03:05,961 --> 00:03:09,301
effectively designed to cater to a diverse user group

86
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,841
they should also quantify

87
00:03:10,841 --> 00:03:13,821
the degree of stigma associated with service robots

88
00:03:14,481 --> 00:03:15,941
we should develop

89
00:03:16,161 --> 00:03:19,741
standardized metrics to evaluate stigma upon robot use

90
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:23,341
and explore optimal strategies for reducing stigma

91
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,401
by investigating these questions

92
00:03:25,401 --> 00:03:27,321
we can pave the way for a more inclusive

93
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:28,701
and accepting society

94
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:30,721
where service robots fulfill their promise

95
00:03:30,721 --> 00:03:32,161
of enhancing quality of life

96
00:03:32,161 --> 00:03:33,941
in addressing societal needs

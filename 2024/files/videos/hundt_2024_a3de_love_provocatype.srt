Hi, I'm Andrew Hundt and I'm going to talk about
our paper: Love, Joy and Autism Robots: A

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:14,250
Metareview and Provocatype with myself Andrew
Hundt, Gabrielle Ohlson, Pieter Wolfert, Lux

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:23,820
Miranda, Sophia Zhu, and Katie Winkle as authors.
We review a set of autism reviews and find that

4
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:29,700
current autism robot research tends to risk
harming autistic people, lack measures of harmful

5
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:39,720
impacts, use deficit language, lack rigor and be
outdated. Interventions are autistic people's

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,440
second to lowest research priority, yet they
dominate autism robot research. And here we're

7
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:53,040
comparing current autism research against autism
robot research. So let's take an example, eye

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:58,440
contact training. That's the most common robot
intervention, it's uncomfortable or even painful

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,040
for many. And among autism interventions, which
was already ranked second to last. Eye contact is

10
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,990
also ranked, within interventions, second to last.
So it's at the bottom of the bottom of the list

11
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:16,260
here, it's the most common intervention, there's
known negative health impacts of camouflaging,

12
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,690
which includes eye contact, and that means it's
not consistent with the benefits and amorphous non

13
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,950
maleficence principles required for most human
subjects research. So, with this in mind, we

14
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:37,050
create a provocative, creative design provocation
for a robot to fix neurotypical spectrum disorder,

15
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:45,150
suffers deficits. So we restate research findings
from a perspective where autistic strengths are

16
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,090
the default. And this iterates on a strategy for
say swapping names in a paper switch the

17
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,820
participant to researcher and if the candidate
sounds like it would be offensive about you, then

18
00:01:56,850 --> 00:02:03,150
that's something to avoid. And reasons why this
matters, an example, is the way that neurotypical

19
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:09,810
peers are less willing to interact with those with
autism, based on thin slice judgments, so even

20
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:17,220
just seeing them for a brief period of time. And
so we go over some common set signs of

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:24,120
neurotypical spectrum disorder, which is
characterized by various deficits and

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,130
difficulties, like understanding direct
communication with the tendency to invent implied

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:36,420
content that isn't present, and difficulty with
avoiding negative assumptions and judgments about

24
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,750
harmlessly divergent people and behaviors. But, we
then took the time to think about that provoca

25
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:48,960
type, and realize that this sort of framing is
really problematic. And really, the risk is too

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:54,870
high of working from that sort of angle, so we
decided to end the project accordingly, and that's

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,530
a robot provacatype is to end the project when
it's appropriate to do so. Then we also recommend

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,930
pursuing top research priorities for autistic
people that's includes mental health and well

29
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:14,130
being identifying and diagnosing autistic people
plus post diagnostic support, services and support

30
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,990
across the lifespan across including social care
and health care. Guess what, people remain

31
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:26,340
autistic if they turn 18, knowledge and attitudes
towards autistic people, and how we view and

32
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:33,510
communicate about autism and the deficit language
we use and keep to the provocative type sort of

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,830
conveys how prevailing attitudes are problematic
and how they could change too, and the rest of the

34
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:47,580
paper goes in about how it could change to be
better. Then we also make recommendations here is

35
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:54,240
a selection: refocus on autistic led research
parties and resources. That's anything from

36
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,520
autistic participants all the way up through
artistic researchers. Use inclusive language,

37
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,130
address individual artistic environmental needs.
Some people are sensory seeking. Some people are

38
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:10,590
sensory avoidant, or have sensory sensitivities,
those vary per autistic individual and those need

39
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:19,830
to be respected. And the autistic SPACE framework
is a paper published last year, that is a really

40
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,890
useful resource to guide safer research
environments. It focuses on medicine, but a lot of

41
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:32,040
the knowledge embedded there is transferable. Then
there's a whole bunch of other key info in the

42
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,790
paper, some disability terminology, historical
events, and more details about our review of

43
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:46,020
autism robot reviews, a summary of essential
current autism research, details about autistic

44
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:53,070
priorities, the robot provoca type and
recommendations and guidance about those findings.

45
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,330
papers that researchers should read if you're
doing autism research, especially autism, robot

46
00:04:57,330 --> 00:05:06,180
research, and changes that should be made into
autism robot projects and policies. And that's a

47
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,960
brief summary of our paper! We hope you enjoy it!
Thanks a lot for joining us!
